# "Android Basics by Google" - Nanodegree Program at Udacity
Udacity offers great range of the programs and courses, grouped by so-called "schools": "Data Science", "Artificial Intelligence", "Programming", "Autonomous Systems", "Cloud Computing" and "Business".

I kept some of their Nanodegree (ND) programs in my wishlist, with intention to enroll sometime in the future when I would have more of the free time :-). However, when Udacity announced free 30-days access to all of their NDs at the end of March 2020, I had no more excuses and decided to start "Android Basics by Google" program.

I officially pledged to "30 Days of Udacity" and committed to spend 1-2 hours per day to learn the basics of Android development. Programs has started on 26th of March, and I plan to complete as much as I can by **26th of April**.

This repo contains all the major projects I've built and submitted as a part of my study. Really great course with an excellent content and very knowledgeable tutors (who are Developer Advocates themselves at Google!). Strongly recommend!
