# "Android Basics by Google" - Nanodegree Program at Udacity
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) offers great range of various training programs and courses, grouped by the so-called "schools": "Data Science", "Artificial Intelligence", "Programming", "Autonomous Systems", "Cloud Computing" and "Business".

I kept some of their Nanodegree (ND) programs in my wishlist for a while, with intention to enrol sometime in the future when I would have more of the free time (dreams, sweet dreams.. :zzz:). However, when Udacity announced free 30-days access to all of their NDs at the end of March 2020, I had no more excuses and decided to start my first ND program - "Android Basics by Google".

I officially pledged to the "30 Days of Udacity" (:hand:) and committed to spend 1-2 hours per day (:muscle:) to learn the basics of the Android Apps development. Program itself has started on **26th of March**, and I managed to get my last (8th!) project approved and graduate on **22nd of April**, just before the deadline!

My "Android Basics Nanodegree by Google" certificate can be verified [here](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/SM4QGCSR).

This repo contains all the main projects I've built and submitted as a part of my study. Really great course (which exceeded my expectations - :star2: !) with an excellent content and a very knowledgeable tutors (who are themselves Developer Advocates at Google!). Strongly recommend to anyone who wants to get into the field of the mobile app development - :thumbsup: !
